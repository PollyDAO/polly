<h3>Polly is on Goerli!</h3>
Polly is available to test and try out on the <a href="https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x56965521CA0fd26d1A6733a87848C00bcd56a0Ac" target="_blank">Goerli testnet</a> and will be made available on Ethereum mainnet later this year.
Interfaces to make interaction with Polly and modules easier will also be added later this year along with the mainnet launch.
Modules will be deployed and tested on the Goerli testnet before they're deployed to mainnet.
Please jump in the <a href="https://discord.gg/jHXs76fWjJ" target="_blank">Discord channel</a> and let us know if you have any questions or issues.

Polly is a protocol for creating, deploying and configuring reusable smart contract modules in custom configurations directly on-chain. The framework makes it easier and cheaper to deploy code to the Ethereum blockchain. Polly is (1) OPEN for all to use and build on through a highly (2) EXTENDABLE architecture. The Polly core, all module versions and user configurations are (3) PERMANENT once deployed.
</>

export const open = <>
The projects and protocols of the future must be accesible and open to all and so must the tools with which they are build. Polly is structured to ensure access for everyone by making the foundational entry points fully permissionless.
</>

export const extendable = <>
The modular approach enables mix and match between Polly modules and custom contracts outside the framework.
</>

export const permanent = <>
At the core of Polly is a non-upgradeable smart contract that stores references to modules and configurations. Once a module is added to the library it can't be removed or changed and will forever be accesible in all its versions.
